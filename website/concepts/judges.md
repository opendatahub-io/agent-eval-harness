# Judges & scoring

A **judge** turns a case's collected outputs into a score. Each case is loaded into a
single `outputs` record, then every judge in `judges:` runs against it. Judges are
deterministic (Python) or stochastic (LLM), boolean or numeric — and the harness
aggregates them into per-judge pass rates and means for the report and
[thresholds](thresholds.md).

## The five judge types

The type is **inferred from which field you set** — there is no `type:` key. When more
than one could apply, the harness resolves in this priority order (see
[`load_judges`](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/agent-eval-harness/blob/main/skills/eval-run/scripts/score.py)):

| Priority | Type | Field(s) set | Runs | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **builtin** | `builtin` | Registered judge from `agent_eval/judges/` | Python judge: whatever it returns · LLM judge (`.md`): boolean |
| 2 | **inline check** | `check` | A Python snippet, in-process | `(bool \| number, rationale)` |
| 3 | **agent** | `agent` (+ `prompt` / `prompt_file` / `llm_rubric`) | An agent run through the runner abstraction (reads a staged workspace) | numeric or boolean via `output/score.json` |
| 4 | **LLM** | `prompt` / `prompt_file` / `llm_rubric` | An Anthropic model call | numeric on `score_range` (told `1–5` when undeclared) or boolean |
| 5 | **external code** | `module` + `function` | An imported Python callable | whatever it returns |

!!! warning "`builtin` is mutually exclusive"
    Setting `builtin` alongside `check`, `prompt`, `prompt_file`, `agent`, `module`, or
    `function` raises a load-time error. The other types are distinguished purely by
    which field is present, so don't set more than one.

!!! note "`agent:` upgrades an LLM judge"
    `agent:` is not mutually exclusive — it coexists with `prompt`/`prompt_file`/`llm_rubric`.
    Adding an `agent:` block upgrades that otherwise-LLM judge from a single model call
    into a tool-using agent run (it's checked *before* the LLM branch).

=== "builtin"

    ```yaml
    judges:
      - name: budget_check
        builtin: cost_budget          # or "category/name", e.g. docs/consulted_docs
        arguments:
          max_cost_usd: 5.0
    ```

    Builtins ship with the harness and need no inline code. Reference them by flat
    name or `category/name`. See [builtin judges](../reference/builtin-judges.md).

=== "inline check"

    ```yaml
    judges:
      - name: has_content
        check: |
          content = outputs["main_content"]
          if len(content.strip()) < 100:
              return False, f"Output too short ({len(content.strip())} chars)"
          return True, f"Output has {len(content.strip())} chars"
    ```

    The snippet is compiled into a function receiving `outputs` and `arguments`. Return
    a `(value, rationale)` tuple — `value` may be a `bool` or a number.

=== "LLM"

    ```yaml
    judges:
      - name: output_quality
        score_range: [1, 5]   # declare the scale — omitting it warns at config load
        prompt: |
          Compare the generated output against the reference. Consider
          completeness, clarity, accuracy. Score 1-5 where 5 is excellent.
    ```

    `prompt` is a full Jinja2 template; `prompt_file` loads one from disk;
    `llm_rubric` is sugar for a one-line criterion (it auto-appends
    `{{ conversation }}` if you don't). Priority when several are set:
    `llm_rubric` > `prompt` > `prompt_file`.

=== "external code"

    ```yaml
    judges:
      - name: schema_valid
        module: eval.judges.schema_checks
        function: check_schema
    ```

    Imports `function` from `module` (resolved against the project root) and calls it
    with `outputs=` (plus any `arguments` as kwargs). Use for validation too complex
    for an inline `check`.

=== "agent"

    ```yaml
    judges:
      - name: architecture_score
        prompt_file: eval/prompts/architecture-agent-judge.md
        model: claude-opus-4-8
        feedback_type: int
        score_range: [0, 2]
        samples: 3
        agent:
          runner: {type: claude-code}               # optional; defaults to claude-code
          allowed_tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]         # read-only default
          context: [.context/architecture-context]  # staged read-only under ./.context/
          inputs: [strat-tasks]                      # output dirs to stage (default: all)
    ```

    An `agent:` block runs the judge as a tool-using agent *through the runner
    abstraction*, against an isolated, staged workspace: the case's output files (filtered
    by `agent.inputs`) plus each `agent.context` dir/file are symlinked in read-only, and a
    writable `./output/` receives the verdict. The judge writes `./output/score.json` —
    `{"score": <integer in [0, 2]>, "rationale": "…"}` or `{"passed": <bool>,
    "rationale": "…"}`. `feedback_type` selects which, and the numeric spec states the
    judge's effective scale (`[1, 5]` when it declares no `score_range`); the harness
    appends the contract + an untrusted-data guard to the prompt automatically. It still
    takes its instructions from `prompt`/`prompt_file`/`llm_rubric` and reuses `model`,
    `samples`, `score_range`, `feedback_type`, `if`, and thresholds like an LLM judge.

    Use it for grading that must **look something up** rather than guess from prompt text:
    verify component/CRD/API claims against real docs, cross-reference a spec, or run the
    touched tests (add `Bash` to `allowed_tools`). See the [judges config
    reference](../reference/config/judges.md) for every `agent:` field.

    !!! warning "`Bash` needs a sandboxed runner"
        The default `allowed_tools` is read-only (`[Read, Grep, Glob]`). Enable `Bash` only
        on a runner with OS-level sandboxing (no network, clean credentials, path
        confinement) — the judge reads untrusted case artifacts. `runner.workspace_mode:
        repo` is rejected for agent judges.

## What judges receive: the `outputs` record

Every judge is called with a single `outputs` dict, assembled per case by
`load_case_record`. It reads *all* files from your configured output dirs — no schema
parsing, so key names come straight from disk. Commonly available keys:

| Key | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `files` | `{relative_path: text}` for every artifact file (binary files become a `{_binary, path, name}` marker) |
| `<dir>_content` / `<dir>_file` | First file's text / path for each `outputs[].path` dir (e.g. `artifacts_content`) |
| `tool_calls` | Captured tool calls for each `outputs[].tool` pattern (`{name, input}`) |
| `annotations` | Parsed `annotations.yaml` from the case's dataset dir |
| `inputs` | Formatted `input.yaml` fields |
| `conversation` | Root-level assistant text extracted from events |
| `events` | Parsed structured event stream (when `traces.events`) |
| `modified_files` | In-place file edits collected during the run |
| `exit_code`, `duration_s`, `token_usage`, `cost_usd`, `num_turns` | Execution metrics (when `traces.metrics`) |
| `stdout`, `stderr` | Logs (when `traces.stdout` / `traces.stderr`) |
| `hook_outputs` | Values emitted by `before_each` hooks |

!!! tip "LLM judge template variables"
    Inside a `prompt`/`prompt_file`/`llm_rubric` template you also get convenience
    variables rendered from the record: `{{ outputs }}` (formatted file listing),
    `{{ conversation }}` (visible text only), `{{ reasoning }}` (visible text plus
    the model's extended-thinking / chain-of-thought, for reasoning-quality judges),
    `{{ tool_trace }}` (chronological tool calls), `{{ inputs }}`, `{{ annotations }}`,
    `{{ evidence }}` (verifiable tool-call summary), and `{{ arguments }}`. Use
    `{{ tool_trace }}` to judge *behaviour* (navigation, tool usage) and
    `{{ conversation }}` to judge the *response*.

## Boolean vs numeric values

A judge's value is either a boolean (pass/fail) or a number (a score). This drives both
how the LLM is prompted and how results aggregate.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    J[Judge value] --> B{bool?}
    B -->|yes| PR["pass_rate = passes / cases<br/>(mean mirrors pass_rate)"]
    B -->|no| N{numeric?}
    N -->|yes| M["mean = avg(values)<br/>(pass_rate = None)"]
    N -->|no| X[not aggregated]
```

For **LLM judges** the shape is set by `feedback_type`:

| `feedback_type` | Tool the judge is forced to call | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *(omitted)*, whole bounds | `submit_score` | integer on `score_range` (default `1–5`) |
| *(omitted)*, fractional bounds e.g. `[0, 2.5]` | `submit_score` | number, the fraction preserved |
| `int` | `submit_score` | integer; a fractional `score_range` is rejected at load |
| `float` | `submit_score` | number on `score_range`, never rounded |
| `bool` | `submit_evaluation` | `passed` (boolean) |

Builtin `.md` LLM judges are always boolean. Inline `check` and external judges decide
their own return type — the aggregator infers boolean vs numeric from the values it
actually sees across cases.

!!! note "Numeric range: declared vs. assumed"
    `score_range: [min, max]` is the judge's scale. When **declared**, it is stated in the
    LLM judge's system prompt and tool schema, colours report cells, normalizes the judge
    in the default reward composition, and is enforced on **every** judge type — a value
    off the scale is recorded as an error sample rather than counted. When **omitted**,
    LLM and agent judges are told `[1, 5]` but nothing is enforced (an inline `check`
    returning a raw count keeps returning it), and the report has no scale to band
    against, so those cells render neutral (uncoloured). Declare the range on every
    numeric judge — omitting it on an LLM or agent judge warns at config load. This is
    independent of
    `reward.score_range` — see the [reward API](reward-api.md).

!!! warning "Upgrading: scores move"
    A numeric LLM judge used to be asked for a `1–5` score whatever its `score_range`
    said, and an agent judge's off-scale verdict was silently clamped into range. The
    declared scale now reaches the model, and a value off it becomes an error sample
    excluded from the mean — so per-judge means shift and `thresholds.min_mean` needs
    re-baselining. Composites move with those values, and an eval with **no** `reward:`
    block moves twice over: that path now normalizes each numeric judge over its own
    `score_range` instead of a flat `[1, 5]`, while a config with an explicit `reward:`
    block still normalizes everything through `reward.score_range`. Don't compare runs
    across the upgrade.

## Aggregation: `pass_rate` vs `mean`

For each judge the harness collects the values across all scored cases and computes:

- **Boolean judges** → `pass_rate` = fraction of `True` values (and `mean` mirrors it).
- **Numeric judges** → `mean` = average of the values (`pass_rate` is `None`).

These feed regression [thresholds](thresholds.md): `min_pass_rate` gates boolean
judges, `min_mean` gates numeric ones (and `min_win_rate` gates the
[pairwise](pairwise-and-sampling.md) judge). Cases skipped by a condition, or that
errored, contribute no value and are excluded from both aggregates.

## Judge arguments

`arguments:` is a mapping that parameterizes a judge, passed differently per type:

- **Python judges** (builtin-python, `check`, external) — spread as `**kwargs` into the
  function.
- **LLM judges** — exposed as `{{ arguments }}` in the template.

```yaml
judges:
  - name: budget_check
    builtin: cost_budget
    arguments:
      max_cost_usd: 5.0        # → cost_budget(outputs, max_cost_usd=5.0)
```

## Conditional judges (`if:`)

`if:` skips a judge for cases where its Python expression is false. The expression is
evaluated with `annotations` and `outputs` in scope (no builtins). Skipped cases are
recorded as skipped and **excluded from `pass_rate`/`mean`** — they don't count as
failures.

```yaml
judges:
  - name: output_quality
    if: "not annotations.get('skip_quality', False)"
    score_range: [1, 5]
    prompt: "Score the output 1-5 for completeness, clarity, and accuracy."
```

!!! note "Annotations come from the dataset"
    `annotations` is the per-case `annotations.yaml` in the dataset directory. See
    [datasets](datasets.md) for how cases carry metadata.

!!! warning "A condition that *raises* is an error, not a skip"
    `annotations['tier']` on a case that has no `tier` key raises, and the expression
    runs without builtins, so a helper like `len(...)` raises too. A blown-up condition
    records an `error` rather than a skip: the judge's summary status flips from `SKIP`
    to `ERROR`, and a case where nothing else scored composes a reward of `0.0` instead
    of the `1.0` a genuinely skipped judge would leave. Prefer
    `annotations.get('tier')`.

## Judge model resolution

LLM and pairwise judges resolve their model with this precedence (first non-empty wins):

```text
per-judge  model:   →   models.judge   →   EVAL_JUDGE_MODEL env
```

If none resolves, an LLM judge fails loudly at load rather than defaulting silently.

```yaml
models:
  judge: claude-opus-4-6      # default for all LLM/pairwise judges

judges:
  - name: strict_review
    prompt: "..."
    score_range: [1, 5]
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6  # overrides models.judge for this judge only
```

!!! tip "Sampling stochastic judges"
    Only LLM judges are stochastic. Set `samples: N` (or `--samples N` on the CLI) to
    run a judge N times per case and reduce — median for numeric, majority vote for
    boolean — surfacing stability in the report. See
    [pairwise & sampling](pairwise-and-sampling.md).
