# Writing custom judges

Judges turn a case's collected outputs into a score. This page shows how to write each
of the five judge types by hand, which variables they receive, and how to parameterize
and conditionally skip them. For the conceptual overview see
[Judges](../concepts/judges.md); for every field, the
[judges reference](../reference/config/judges.md).

## The five types

A judge's *type* is inferred from which field you set — you never declare it.

| Field(s) | Type | Runs | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `builtin` | Library judge | Deterministic Python | `(bool\|number, str)` |
| `check` | Inline Python | Deterministic | `(bool\|number, str)` |
| `prompt` / `prompt_file` / `llm_rubric` | LLM judge | An API call to `models.judge` | pass/fail, or a score on the judge's `score_range` (`1–5` when undeclared) |
| the above **+ `agent`** | Agent judge | A tool-using agent run via the runner | pass/fail or a numeric score |
| `module` + `function` | External code | Your imported callable | `(bool\|number, str)` |

!!! warning "One type per judge"
    The type fields are mutually exclusive. Setting `builtin` alongside any of
    `check` / `prompt` / `prompt_file` / `module` / `function` fails at config load.

Every judge — regardless of type — receives the same `outputs` record for the case: the
files it produced, its trace, metrics, annotations, and convenience keys. Numeric
(score) judges aggregate to a **mean**; boolean judges to a **pass rate**.

## Inline `check` judges

The most direct type: a snippet of Python whose body becomes a function. Two names are
in scope — `outputs` (the case record) and `arguments` (this judge's `arguments` dict,
`{}` if unset). Return a `(value, rationale)` tuple where `value` is a `bool` or a
number and `rationale` is a human-readable string shown in the report.

```yaml title="eval.yaml"
judges:
  - name: has_content
    description: Output is non-empty and substantial.
    check: |
      content = outputs.get("main_content", "")
      if len(content.strip()) < 100:
          return False, f"Output too short ({len(content.strip())} chars)"
      return True, f"Output has {len(content.strip())} chars"
```

!!! tip "Use `outputs.get(...)` with a default"
    A case that produced no artifacts won't have every convenience key. Reaching for a
    missing key with `outputs["main_content"]` raises `KeyError`, which the runner
    records as a judge *error* (no value) rather than a fail. `outputs.get("main_content", "")`
    degrades gracefully.

The record exposes far more than files. Common keys for `check` judges:

| Key | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `outputs["files"]` | `{relative_path: text}` for every collected artifact |
| `outputs["<dir>_content"]` / `outputs["<dir>_file"]` | First file's text / path per `outputs[].path` dir |
| `outputs["tool_calls"]` | Tool calls matching an `outputs[].tool` pattern (`{"name", "input"}`) |
| `outputs["cost_usd"]`, `["num_turns"]`, `["duration_s"]`, `["token_usage"]`, `["exit_code"]` | Trace metrics (require `traces.metrics: true`) |
| `outputs["events"]` | Parsed event stream (require `traces.events: true`) |
| `outputs["conversation"]` | Root-level assistant text |
| `outputs["stdout"]`, `["stderr"]` | Captured logs (require `traces.stdout` / `stderr`) |
| `outputs["annotations"]` | Per-case metadata from `annotations.yaml` |

A metrics-driven check reads straight from the trace:

```yaml
judges:
  - name: cost_reasonable
    description: Cost per case stays under budget.
    check: |
      cost = outputs.get("cost_usd", 0) or 0
      if cost > arguments.get("max_usd", 0.50):
          return False, f"Cost ${cost:.2f} exceeds limit"
      return True, f"Cost ${cost:.2f}"
    arguments:
      max_usd: 0.50
```

## External `module` / `function` judges

When a check outgrows an inline snippet — it needs helpers, imports, or its own tests —
move it into a Python module in your project and point `module` + `function` at it. The
module is imported with your project root on `sys.path`. The function is called with the
record as the `outputs` keyword argument, and any `arguments` are spread in as
`**kwargs`, so mirror the builtin-judge signature:

```python title="eval/judges/schema_checks.py"
import json

def check_schema(outputs, **kwargs):
    required = kwargs.get("required_fields", [])
    raw = outputs.get("main_content", "")
    try:
        doc = json.loads(raw)
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        return False, f"Invalid JSON: {e}"
    missing = [f for f in required if f not in doc]
    if missing:
        return False, f"Missing fields: {', '.join(missing)}"
    return True, "Schema valid"
```

```yaml title="eval.yaml"
judges:
  - name: schema_valid
    description: Output parses and has the required fields.
    module: eval.judges.schema_checks
    function: check_schema
    arguments:
      required_fields: [title, priority, labels]
```

!!! note "Return contract is shared"
    Builtin, `check`, and `module` judges all return the same shape: a
    `(value, rationale)` tuple (value = `bool` or number). Returning a bare value with no
    rationale works too, but the report shows an empty rationale. The library judge
    [`cost_budget`](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/agent-eval-harness/blob/main/agent_eval/judges/efficiency/cost_budget.py)
    is a minimal example of the same signature.

!!! warning "A declared `score_range` is enforced on these judges too"
    `score_range` is not just report colouring. A `builtin`, `check`, or `module` judge
    whose returned number falls outside its declared range — or is non-finite — is
    recorded as an **error sample** (`value: null` plus an `error`, and a `WARNING` line
    on stderr) and left out of the judge's mean. The value is never rounded or clamped:
    rounding only happens where a *model's* answer is parsed. So declare
    `score_range: [0, 8]` only if the judge genuinely cannot return 9; leave the range
    off for an unbounded count and the judge keeps emitting whatever it computes.

## LLM judges

For qualitative criteria, hand the case to a model. Choose one of three fields — they
all compile to the same Jinja2 template, then render against the case record:

=== "llm_rubric"

    Shortest form for a single criterion. If your text doesn't already reference
    `{{ conversation }}`, the agent's response is appended automatically.

    ```yaml
    judges:
      - name: cited_sources
        feedback_type: bool     # one yes/no criterion — no scale to declare
        llm_rubric: "The agent cited relevant documentation sources."
    ```

=== "prompt"

    Full control over the template and placeholders.

    ```yaml
    judges:
      - name: output_quality
        description: Compare the output to the reference.
        score_range: [1, 5]     # declare the scale — omitting it warns at config load
        prompt: |
          Compare the generated output against the reference for
          completeness, clarity, and accuracy.

          {{ inputs }}

          # Output
          {{ outputs }}
    ```

=== "prompt_file"

    Reuse a prompt across judges/configs. Path is relative to the project root.
    `context` files are appended to the prompt for shared rubrics.

    ```yaml
    judges:
      - name: detailed_quality
        score_range: [1, 5]
        prompt_file: eval/prompts/quality-judge.md
        context:
          - eval/prompts/scoring-rubric.md
    ```

### Available Jinja variables

The prompt is rendered with these variables:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `{{ outputs }}` | The record. Bare, it renders every artifact file as text; use `{{ outputs.files }}`, `{{ outputs.cost_usd }}`, etc. for structured access |
| `{{ conversation }}` | Root-level assistant **visible** text from the event stream (excludes extended-thinking) |
| `{{ reasoning }}` | `{{ conversation }}` plus the model's extended-thinking (chain-of-thought), for reasoning-quality judges |
| `{{ inputs }}` | The case's `input.yaml`, formatted as `**key**: value` |
| `{{ tool_trace }}` | Chronological trace of tool calls (Read, Bash, …) |
| `{{ evidence }}` | Summary of verifiable tool evidence (turns, cost, files read/written) — derived only if referenced |
| `{{ annotations }}` | Case annotations as formatted text; also `{{ annotations.get('category') }}` for values |
| `{{ annotations_text }}` | The annotation text alone |
| `{{ arguments }}` | This judge's `arguments` dict |

!!! tip "Score scale vs. pass/fail"
    With no `score_range` an LLM judge returns an integer score on the unenforced **1–5**
    default (aggregated as a mean) and warns at config load — declare the scale. Set
    `feedback_type: bool` to make it a **pass/fail** judge (aggregated as a pass rate).
    `{{ tool_trace }}`, `{{ evidence }}`, and `{{ reasoning }}` need `traces.events: true`;
    `{{ conversation }}` falls back to `stdout.log` when no events were captured.

!!! tip "Grading on a scale other than 1–5"
    Declare it: `score_range: [0, 2]`. The range is stated in the judge's system prompt,
    set as `minimum`/`maximum` on the `submit_score` tool schema, and used to normalize the
    judge in every reward composition. Because a tool schema is *advisory* — the model
    is not constrained by `minimum`/`maximum` — a returned value off the scale is recorded
    as an **error sample** and left out of the judge's mean rather than clamped onto the
    scale, where a 4 from a 0-2 judge would land as a perfect 2. With `samples: 3` the case
    still reduces over the surviving samples, so one bad sample costs a stability flag. Keep
    stating the scale in the rubric text as well; a prompt that says "score 0, 1, or 2" and
    a config that says nothing is the combination that produced silently out-of-range scores
    ([#182](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/agent-eval-harness/issues/182)).
    An LLM judge's answer is rounded to an integer unless the scale says otherwise — declare
    `feedback_type: float`, or fractional bounds such as `[0, 2.5]`, for a continuous scale.

LLM judges — including the agent judges below — are the only types that can be
**sampled**. Set `samples: 3` to call the model several times per case and reduce the
noise (median for scores, majority vote for booleans); the report flags cases where
samples disagreed. `samples` on any other type is ignored with a warning.

## Agent judges

Of the types above, only **LLM** judges (`prompt`/`prompt_file`/`llm_rubric`, and LLM
`builtin`s) make a model call — a single, stateless one from the prompt text they're
handed; `check`, external `module`/`function`, and Python `builtin` judges run
deterministic code with no model call. An **agent judge** upgrades an LLM judge into a
*tool-using* run: add an `agent:` block and the judge executes through the
[runner abstraction](../concepts/runners.md) in a staged, isolated workspace, where it may
take **multiple tool-using turns** — `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` over the case's artifacts **and
reference docs** — before it decides. Reach for it when a verdict must *look something up*
rather than guess.

The judge still takes its instructions from `prompt` / `prompt_file` / `llm_rubric`, and
reuses `model`, `feedback_type`, `score_range`, `samples`, `if`, and thresholds exactly
like an LLM judge — the `agent:` block is the only thing that changes how it runs. Its
inputs are the case's collected output files (filtered by `agent.inputs`, default all)
plus each `agent.context` dir staged read-only under `./.context/`; its one writable spot
is `./output/`, for the verdict file.

Say you grade whether a strategy's architecture claims are real. A text-only LLM judge
has no way to check component names, CRDs, or API fields against the platform docs, so it
trusts the output and inflates the score to full marks. An agent judge greps the actual
architecture-context docs and marks down invented components:

```yaml title="eval.yaml"
judges:
  - name: architecture_score
    description: Component/CRD/API claims check out against the real arch-context docs.
    prompt_file: eval/prompts/architecture-agent-judge.md
    model: claude-opus-4-8
    feedback_type: int
    score_range: [0, 2]
    samples: 3
    agent:
      runner: { type: claude-code }             # per-judge runner (default claude-code)
      allowed_tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]         # read-only default
      context: [.context/architecture-context]  # staged read-only under ./.context/
      inputs: [strat-tasks]                      # which output dirs to stage (default: all)
      # timeout: 420        # default: execution.timeout or 600s
      # max_budget_usd: 2.0 # per-judge-run cap (default 2.0)
```

The prompt file holds only the criteria — the harness appends the output contract and an
untrusted-data guard for you:

```markdown title="eval/prompts/architecture-agent-judge.md"
Grade the strategy in ./strat-tasks/. For every component, CRD, and API it names,
Grep ./.context/architecture-context/ to confirm it exists. Score 0 (claims are
invented) to 2 (every claim verified).
```

The agent ends by writing its verdict to `./output/score.json` — numeric here because
`feedback_type: int`:

```json title="output/score.json"
{"score": 1, "rationale": "TrainingRuntime CRD and the Kueue integration verified against arch-context; the referenced ModelMeshRouter component does not exist."}
```

!!! tip "Output contract, and the stdout fallback"
    Write `{"score": <number>, "rationale": "…"}` for numeric judges or
    `{"passed": <bool>, "rationale": "…"}` when `feedback_type: bool`. If `score.json` is
    missing, the harness parses the last such JSON object from the run's stdout; if
    neither yields a value the case records an **error** sample — an agent judge never
    silently passes.

!!! warning "`Bash` needs a sandboxed runner"
    The default `allowed_tools` is read-only (`[Read, Grep, Glob]`). Only add `Bash`
    (e.g. to run the tests a change touched) on a runner with OS-level sandboxing — no
    network, cleaned credentials, path confinement — because the judge reads untrusted
    case artifacts. `..`-bearing artifact paths are containment-checked, and
    `runner.workspace_mode: repo` is rejected for agent judges: they must run in the
    isolated staged workspace.

## `arguments`: parameterizing a judge

`arguments` is a plain dict, reused by every type — but consumed differently:

- **Python judges** (`builtin`, `check`, `module`) — spread in as `**kwargs` (`check`
  judges also see it as the `arguments` variable).
- **LLM judges** — exposed as `{{ arguments }}` inside the template.

This lets one judge implementation serve many thresholds without duplicating code — see
the `max_usd` and `required_fields` examples above.

## `if`: skipping a judge per case

Give a judge an `if:` expression to run it only on the cases where it's meaningful. The
expression is evaluated against `annotations` and `outputs`; when it's false the judge is
**skipped** — the case isn't counted in that judge's mean or pass rate.

```yaml title="eval.yaml"
judges:
  - name: dedup_correct
    if: "annotations.get('is_duplicate', False)"   # only duplicate cases
    feedback_type: bool
    prompt: "Did the agent correctly flag the input as a duplicate?"

  - name: output_quality
    if: "not annotations.get('skip_quality', False)"
    feedback_type: int
    score_range: [1, 5]
    prompt: "Score the output 1-5 for completeness, clarity, and accuracy."
```

!!! warning "`if` runs in a restricted sandbox"
    The `if` expression is evaluated with **no builtins** — only `annotations` and
    `outputs` are in scope. Keep it to simple attribute/`.get()` lookups and boolean
    logic. Put anything heavier inside the judge body (`check`/`module`), which runs with
    full builtins.
