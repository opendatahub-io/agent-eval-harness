# Execution Monitoring Reference

## Launching

Launch execute.py using the Bash tool with `run_in_background: true`, and **do NOT
redirect or pipe its output** — no `>`, `|`, `tee`, `2>&1`, `tail`, `head`, or
`grep`. Claude Code's background-command viewer (and the output-file path the Bash
tool returns) shows the process's *own* stdout/stderr stream; any redirect or pipe
diverts that stream and leaves the viewer blank. The command must be the bare
`python3 ... execute.py ...` invocation. You don't need a redirect for a durable
log: execute.py already mirrors its live console to `<output_dir>/console.log`, and
emits a `WARNING:` if it detects its stdout was redirected into the run directory.

## Session lifecycle warning

**Do not end your turn while execute.py is running.** Background tasks are killed
when the session becomes idle — this applies to both headless and interactive
modes:

- **Headless (`-p`):** ending the turn exits the session immediately, killing all
  background tasks and producing empty results that CI reports as green.
  (This warning is about the eval session's own execute.py task. Separately,
  INSIDE each case, the CLI kills the skill-under-test's background tasks that
  outlive its final turn at the bg-wait ceiling -- the harness detects that and
  fails the case with exit_code=1; see Detecting problems below.)
- **Interactive:** Claude Code SIGTERMs background tasks after ~55 minutes of
  session inactivity. A long-running execute.py (common with 20+ cases) will be
  killed silently if no tool calls keep the session active.

You must keep polling until execution completes. Poll every 2–3 minutes with
`tail -20 <output_file>` (the path the Bash tool returned) or
`tail -20 <output_dir>/console.log` (the run dir passed via `--output`) — never a
self-created redirect. Polling keeps the session active and prevents the idle
timeout from firing.

## Monitoring progress

Once launched, the Bash tool returns an output file path. Monitor by reading it (or
the stable `console.log` mirror) — never a self-created redirect:

```bash
tail -20 <output_file>             # the path the Bash tool returned
tail -20 <output_dir>/console.log  # execute.py's own mirrored console
```

Look for phase markers (`## Phase`, `## Step`, `Batch N/M`), agent counts
(`N agents launched`, `N/M done`), and completion signals (`Done`). Summarize
concisely — e.g., "Batch 2/4: review agents 3/5 complete" rather than dumping
raw output.

## Detecting problems

If the last lines haven't changed across two checks (~2-3 min apart), the
pipeline may be stuck. Common signs:

- Repeated `sleep` commands with no progress change → agents may have timed out
- `ERROR` or `Traceback` in the output → script failure, report immediately
- No new output for 5+ minutes → possible hang, check if the process is running
- `exit code` or `EXIT:` appearing → execution finished (check the code)
- `ERROR: the CLI terminated still-running background tasks at the bg-wait
  ceiling` in stderr.log -> the case's background agents (common in pipeline
  skills) outlived the final turn and were killed after
  `CLAUDE_CODE_PRINT_BG_WAIT_CEILING_MS` (default 600s); their artifacts may be
  half-written, and the harness fails the case (`exit_code=1`) even though the
  CLI exited 0. First check whether the skill MEANT to end its turn there: a
  dispatcher that should have awaited its agents has a turn-discipline defect
  to fix in the skill. Only for intentionally long-running background work,
  raise the ceiling -- `CLAUDE_CODE_PRINT_BG_WAIT_CEILING_MS` via `runner.env:`
  in eval.yaml or exported (the key is on the runner's env allowlist); keep
  `execution.timeout` finite as the backstop rather than defaulting to `"0"`

Report issues with the relevant output lines rather than waiting for completion.

## After execution

Check `run_result.json` for execution metadata:

```bash
cat $AGENT_EVAL_RUNS_DIR/<eval-name>/<id>/run_result.json
```

Key fields: `exit_code`, `duration_s`, `wall_clock_s` (lower when parallelism is
used), `cost_usd`, `num_turns`, `per_model_usage`, `per_model_turns`,
`permission_denials` (structured list of tool calls denied by permissions,
`[{tool_name, tool_use_id, tool_input}]`, `[]` when none; in case mode each
`per_case` entry carries its own list and the top level the concatenation).
`cost_usd` is billed cost: when the `per_model_usage` sum exceeds the
conversation total by more than $0.01 (background agents killed at the bg-wait
ceiling, or still running at an evaluator timeout), the larger figure is
published.

If `exit_code` is non-zero, report the failure with the exit code, duration, and
the first and last few lines of `stderr.log` (harness-appended `ERROR:` notes,
such as the background-task bg-wait-ceiling kill, land at the end). Do not
continue to scoring. Also check `permission_denials` per case: a non-empty
list with exit_code 0 means the agent was silently blocked from tool calls
(e.g. a nested Skill call missing from `permissions.allow`) and may have
partially completed without failing.

## CLI flag fallbacks

Most execute.py flags fall back to eval.yaml config values:

- `--agent` → `runner.type` (default `claude-code`)
- `--model` → `models.skill` (required — errors if unset)
- `--mlflow-experiment` → `mlflow.experiment`
- `--skill-args` → `execution.arguments` (`{field}` placeholders resolved per case)
- `--effort` → `runner.effort` (Claude Code only)
- `--parallelism` → `execution.parallelism` (concurrent via thread pool)

Override via CLI only when testing different combinations than config specifies.
