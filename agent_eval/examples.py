"""Few-shot judge exemplars harvested from human review labels.

``/eval-review`` persists human feedback per run as
``$AGENT_EVAL_RUNS_DIR/<eval-name>/<run-id>/review.yaml``. A judge that
declares ``examples: {source: reviews}`` gets a handful of those human-labeled
cases injected into its prompt as calibration anchors — the judge sees what a
human actually accepted and rejected on this eval, instead of inferring the
bar from the rubric text alone.

Two review.yaml shapes are read (the structured one is the human-calibration
schema /eval-review writes when per-judge verdicts are collected):

    feedback:                # flat: case -> free-text comment
      case-001: "too vague"  #   non-empty = the reviewer flagged the case
      case-002: ""           #   empty = acceptable
    verdicts:                # structured: the human's own verdict per judge,
      case-001:              #   on each judge's OWN scale
        format_check: true   #   bool judge -> true/false
        output_quality: 4    #   numeric judge -> value within score_range

A per-judge verdict wins over the flat case-level label when both are present.
Selection is deterministic (sorted, no randomness), and the case currently
being judged is always excluded — an exemplar must never leak a human verdict
on its own case (same spirit as the answer-key guard).
