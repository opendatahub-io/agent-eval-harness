"""Materialize shared ``dataset.workspace.files`` entries into a workspace.

A ``WorkspaceFile`` (``{dest, source}``) entry references a project or plugin
resource that must be *copied* — never symlinked — into every case workspace.
This is the single implementation of that materialization, shared by the local
``/eval-run`` path, Harbor task packaging, and the S3/EvalHub export step, so the
trust boundary and copy semantics stay identical across substrates.

Plain string entries are per-case files handled by the case-directory copy and
are ignored here.
