**Agent Eval Harness** evaluates skills and agent capabilities with one declarative
`eval.yaml`: analyze → generate cases → run → judge → trace in MLflow → optimize.
Same config on your laptop, Harbor containers, or EvalHub.

## Why Agent Eval Harness

- **One config everywhere.** `eval.yaml` drives local runs, Harbor, and EvalHub.
- **Skill or prompt mode.** Test packaged skills, or agent capabilities directly
  (including agentic documentation checks).
- **Robust scoring.** LLM + code judges, pairwise A/B, thresholds, and HTML reports.
- **MLflow-native traces.** Opt-in experiments, datasets, and hierarchical GenAI traces.
- **Close the loop.** `/eval-optimize` proposes skill fixes from failures and re-runs.

## Execution Model

The harness separates **how many invocations** (`execution.mode`) from **what to execute** (`execution.skill` or `execution.prompt`):

### Execution Mode
- **case**: One invocation per test case (default). The harness loops over cases.
- **batch**: One invocation for all cases via batch.yaml. The skill/agent loops internally.

### What to Execute
- **Skill mode** (`execution.skill`): Test predefined skill implementations (`/my-skill --args`). Evaluates skill correctness, quality, and cost efficiency.
- **Prompt mode** (`execution.prompt`) ✨ NEW: Test agent capabilities directly by sending prompts without a skill wrapper. Extensible to any agent evaluation scenario.

**Implemented flavor - Agentic Documentation Testing** (see `examples/openshift-agentic-docs.md`):
- **Documentation effectiveness**: Can agents navigate and use your docs?
- **Pattern understanding**: Can agents identify and apply code patterns?
- **Constraint compliance**: Do agents respect documented rules?
- **API usage**: Can agents correctly use APIs from documentation alone?

**Extensible to other scenarios**:
- Code generation from specifications
- API usage pattern validation  
- Reasoning trace quality assessment
- Custom agent capability benchmarks

Useful for testing documentation quality (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, ai-docs/), onboarding effectiveness, and establishing agent baseline capabilities.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add to your project

Install from the [skills registry](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/skills-registry):

```bash
claude plugin install agent-eval-harness@opendatahub-skills
```

Or clone and load as a local plugin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opendatahub-io/agent-eval-harness
pip install -e ./agent-eval-harness
claude --plugin-dir ./agent-eval-harness
```

This makes all eval skills available: `/eval-setup`, `/eval-analyze`, `/eval-dataset`, `/eval-run`, `/eval-review`, `/eval-mlflow`, `/eval-optimize`, `/eval-compare`, `/eval-anova`, and `/eval-check`.

### 2. Set up environment

```
/eval-setup
```

This checks dependencies, configures MLflow, verifies API keys, and creates directories.

### 3a. Analyze your skill (skill mode)

```bash
/eval-analyze --skill my-skill
```

This examines the skill's SKILL.md, discovers test cases, and generates `eval.yaml` with:
- `execution.mode: case` or `batch`
- Natural language `schema` descriptions of your dataset and outputs
- Suggested judges (inline checks + LLM quality assessment)
- Regression thresholds

### 3b. Analyze for prompt mode evaluation

```bash
/eval-analyze --prompt examples/openshift-agentic-docs.md
```

This analyzes your repository's documentation (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, ai-docs/) and generates `eval.yaml` with:
- `execution.prompt: "{{ input.prompt }}"` (prompt mode)
- A `generation:` block with builtin documentation prompts (`docs/navigation`, `docs/anti-pattern`, etc.)
- LLM rubric judges for semantic evaluation
- Documentation tracking to verify agents use docs correctly

**Note**: Prompt mode is extensible. The OpenShift analysis prompt is a domain-specific example. You can create custom analysis prompts for other domains or agent capability testing scenarios.

### 4. Generate test cases (if needed)

```
/eval-dataset
```

Creates 5 starter test cases based on the skill analysis. Skip this if you already have cases.

### 5. Run evaluation

```
/eval-run --model opus
```

This prepares a workspace, runs the skill (headless or interactive), collects artifacts, scores with judges, and reports results.

## eval.yaml

The harness uses natural language to describe evaluation datasets and skills input/output and spawns LLM sub-agents to interpret them.

### Key concepts

- **`execution`** — `mode` determines how evaluation runs:
  - **`case`** (default, skill mode): Skill invoked once per test case with `{field}` placeholders resolved from each case's input.yaml
  - **`batch`** (skill mode): All cases bundled into batch.yaml for a single skill invocation
  - **`prompt`** (prompt mode): Agent receives prompts directly without a skill wrapper, useful for testing agent capabilities like documentation navigation, pattern understanding, constraint compliance, etc.
  
  Additional fields: `arguments` template, optional `timeout` (wall-clock seconds per invocation), `max_budget_usd` (cost cap per invocation), `parallelism` (run up to N cases concurrently in case/prompt modes), and `env` for injecting environment variables into workspaces (`$VAR` syntax resolves from caller's environment).
- **`schema`** — natural language description of structure. Used on `dataset` and each `outputs` entry. Agents and judges read these to understand the data.
- **`generation`** — optional top-level block selecting case **provenance** via `strategy`: `skill` (default — agent authors from skill analysis; needs no block), `synthetic` (LLM generates from seeds), or `from-traces` (extracted from MLflow production traces). For `synthetic`: `context` holds repository-specific knowledge (`documentation_structure`, `constraints`, `apis`, `components`, etc.) injected into every generation prompt, and `seeds` is a list where each seed has a `category`, a `count`, and exactly one **generation prompt** discriminator (mirroring judges): `builtin` (from `agent_eval/prompts/`, e.g. `docs/navigation` — discover with `list_prompts.py`), `prompt_file` (a project path), or an inline `prompt`. Each seed's `category` is stamped onto generated cases as `annotations.category`. `seeds`/`context` apply only to `synthetic`.
- **`inputs.tools`** — tool interception for headless and interactive execution. Each entry has a `match` (what to intercept) and a `prompt` (how to handle it). AskUserQuestion uses 3-tier answering: exact `case_overrides` → LLM call (`models.hook`) with case context (`input.yaml` + `answers.yaml`) → fallback to first option.
- **`outputs`** — two types: `path` for file artifacts on disk, `tool` for tool call side effects (Jira, APIs). Both have `schema` descriptions. Optional `batch_pattern` maps output files to cases in batch mode using `{n}` as a 1-based index (e.g. `"RFE-{n:03d}"` → `RFE-001`, `RFE-002`).
- **`traces`** — execution data to capture: stdout/stderr logs, events (tool calls, reasoning text, results), metrics (exit code, tokens, cost, duration). Available to judges via the `outputs` dict.
- **`check`** — inline Python snippet for deterministic validation. Receives an `outputs` dict with file contents, execution metadata, tool calls, logs, and `annotations` (from dataset `annotations.yaml`). Returns `(bool, str)`.
- **`if`** — optional condition on a judge. Python expression evaluated against `annotations` and `outputs`. When false, the judge is skipped for that case (not counted in pass_rate or mean).
- **`prompt`** / **`prompt_file`** / **`llm_rubric`** — LLM judge evaluation instructions. All three compile to the same internal prompt before Jinja2 rendering. Priority order: `llm_rubric` > `prompt` > `prompt_file`.
  - **`llm_rubric`**: Syntactic sugar for simple criteria. Auto-appends `{{ conversation }}` template if missing. Best for synthetic-generation configs. Example: `llm_rubric: "Agent cited documentation sources"`
  - **`prompt`**: Full Jinja2 template with manual control. Use for complex logic or multiple placeholders like `{{ outputs }}`, `{{ conversation }}`, `{{ tool_trace }}`, `{{ inputs }}`, `{{ evidence }}`.
  - **`prompt_file`**: External file path (absolute or relative to project root). Use for sharing prompts across judges. File can contain rubric-style or full template content.
- **`context`** — list of file paths loaded and appended to the LLM judge prompt as supplementary material (rubrics, guidelines, examples).
- **`module`** / **`function`** — external Python code judge for complex validation.
- **`feedback_type`** / **`score_range`** — the judge's verdict shape and numeric scale. `feedback_type: bool` gives a pass/fail verdict; anything else gives a `score` on `score_range`. A **declared** scale reaches the model — it is stated in the judge's system prompt and in the `submit_score` tool schema — and the returned value is enforced against it: a value outside the scale is recorded as an error sample rather than clamped, because clamping a 4 from a 0-2 judge into a 2 invents a perfect score. Omit the range and the judge is only *told* `[1, 5]`, with nothing checking the answer — so a numeric LLM or agent judge without one warns at config load. Incoherent combinations (`bool` with a `score_range`, `int` with fractional bounds, a non-`bool` `feedback_type` or any `score_range` on a builtin LLM judge) and unknown `builtin:` names fail at config load.

  > **Upgrading:** LLM judges with a non-default `score_range` were previously asked for a `[1, 5]` score regardless of what they declared, and nothing checked the answer; agent judges *were* told their declared range, but an off-scale verdict was silently clamped into it. Both are now asked for, and held to, the scale they declare. How much a mean moves depends on the rubric: a prompt that already stated "0-2" was often answered on 0-2 anyway, since the rubric text competes with the system prompt and usually wins — in one 1,449-sample corpus every value was already on the declared scale. A rubric that left the scale to the config will move more, and in either direction. Two further changes affect existing runs: an off-scale value is now an **error sample** rather than a number, so a judge whose model ignores its scale can end up with no mean at all; and *every* reward composition — the default one and an explicit `reward:` block alike — now normalizes a numeric judge over its own `score_range` instead of a flat `[1, 5]` (judges listed in `reward.raw`, and a single-judge reward without `normalize: true`, are clamped as before), which shifts `reward.json` and `anova.json`. A `[0, 2]` judge scoring 0/1/2 used to compose to `0.0`/`0.0`/`0.25` and now composes to `0.0`/`0.5`/`1.0`. `reward.score_range` is deprecated by the same change: it is now only a fallback for composed judges that declare no range of their own, and writing it warns at config load once one of them declares a different range. Two smaller ones: in the default path a case whose every scoring judge errored now composes to `0.0` rather than `1.0`, and an LLM response with no parseable score is now an error sample rather than the old silent `3`. Re-baseline any `thresholds.min_mean` tuned against the old numbers, and do not compare pre- and post-upgrade runs. A live GRPO loop needs the same treatment: rewards are on a different scale after the upgrade, so re-baseline it rather than continuing against rollouts collected before.
- **`agent`** — turns a judge into a tool-using **agent judge**: instead of a single stateless model call, the judge runs as an agent *through the runner abstraction*, with read-only file tools and a staged, isolated workspace, so it can Read/Grep/Glob the material and any reference docs to **ground its verdict** (e.g. verify architecture claims against the real docs) instead of guessing from prompt text. An agent judge still takes its instructions from `prompt`/`prompt_file`/`llm_rubric`, and reuses `model`, `feedback_type`, `score_range`, `samples`, `if`, and `thresholds` like any other judge. The presence of an `agent:` block is what upgrades an otherwise-LLM judge. Sub-keys (all optional):
  - **`runner`** — a per-judge runner block, parsed exactly like the top-level `runner:` (`type`, `effort`, `command`, `env`, …). Defaults to `{type: claude-code}`. Lets the judge use a different runner/model stack than the skill-under-test.
  - **`allowed_tools`** — tool allowlist for the judge (read-only default `[Read, Grep, Glob]`; add `Bash` for judges that must run commands, e.g. a tests-pass judge). The judge sees only its own staged workspace, never other cases or the real repo tree.
  - **`context`** — dirs/files staged **read-only** into the judge workspace under `./.context/<name>` for the agent to consult (distinct from the top-level `context:`, which is appended to the prompt text).
  - **`inputs`** — which collected output dirs (by `outputs[].path` name) to stage as files; default: all of `outputs["files"]`. Use `[.]` to stage everything.
  - **`timeout`** — seconds (default: `execution.timeout` or harness default). **`max_budget_usd`** — per-judge-run cap (default `2.0`).

  The judge writes its verdict to `./output/score.json` — `{"score": <number>, "rationale": "…"}` (numeric) or `{"passed": <bool>, "rationale": "…"}` (bool); `feedback_type` selects which, and `score_range` states the scale in the prompt, bands the score in the report, and records an off-scale verdict as an error sample rather than counting it. The harness appends this output contract (plus an untrusted-data guard) to the prompt automatically, so rubric authors write only the criteria. If `score.json` is absent, the harness falls back to parsing the last `{"score"|"passed", …}` JSON object from the run's stdout; if neither yields a value it records an error sample rather than silently passing. Example:

  ```yaml
  judges:
    - name: architecture_score
      prompt_file: eval/prompts/architecture-agent-judge.md
      model: claude-opus-4-8
      feedback_type: int
      score_range: [0, 2]
      samples: 3
      agent:
        runner: {type: claude-code, effort: high}   # optional; defaults to claude-code
        allowed_tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]           # read-only default
        context: [.context/architecture-context]    # staged read-only under ./.context/
        inputs: [strat-tasks]                        # which output dirs to stage (default: all)
        timeout: 420
        max_budget_usd: 2.0
  ```
- **`permissions`** — tool access patterns (`allow`/`deny`) for headless execution. Claude Code enforces these exactly. Codex maps `runner.permission_mode` to its filesystem sandbox and warns because it cannot translate Claude's tool-level patterns.
- **`runner`** — `type` selects `claude-code`, `codex`, `cli`, or `responses-api`; remaining fields are runner-specific. Codex accepts `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh`; its CLI does not enforce `max_budget_usd`. Local Codex defaults to `workspace-write`; `permission_mode: plan` maps to `read-only`, while `bypassPermissions` maps to Codex's unrestricted bypass and should be used only inside a container or VM.
- **`models`** — `skill`/`subagent`/`judge`/`hook` defaults, overridable per-judge or via CLI flags. `hook` is the model used for LLM-based AskUserQuestion answering. `hook_shadow` (max 2 model ids — cross-family via gateway aliases) adds shadow simulators that also answer every intercepted question — logged for cross-simulator agreement, never injected (adds up to 2 LLM calls per question inside the hook budget).
- **`mlflow`** — `experiment` (and optional `tracking_uri`/`tags`) for result logging.
- **`thresholds`** — per-judge regression detection. Valid keys: `min_mean` (minimum average score), `min_pass_rate` (minimum fraction of cases passing, 0.0–1.0), `min_win_rate` (minimum pairwise win rate), `max_error_rate` (**maximum** fraction of cases the judge may error on, 0.0–1.0 — an opt-in coverage gate; the other three are computed over the cases that produced a value), `min_alpha` (minimum single-judge self-consistency alpha — an upper bound on inter-rater reliability — computed over the sampling matrix when the judge runs with `samples > 1`; all-identical ratings pass as a healthy degenerate, while a configured-but-unavailable alpha is a regression; skipped with a notice on the Harbor/EvalHub execution paths), `min_human_agreement` (minimum judge-vs-human agreement — Cohen's kappa or Krippendorff's alpha — merged by `score.py calibration` from `/eval-review` verdicts; a judge that was never calibrated is silently skipped, perfect agreement passes as a healthy degenerate, and a stale calibration — dropped by a re-score while the run-level `human_calibration` block still lists the judge — is a regression)), `min_panel_alpha` (minimum cross-model panel alpha for a judge whose `model` is a list of 2-4 ids — a judge panel; perfect-agreement matrices pass as a healthy degenerate, a configured-but-unavailable panel alpha is a regression, and the gate is skipped with a notice on the Harbor/EvalHub paths — panels still execute in-container on Harbor at m× judge cost while the cross-case alpha is not aggregated there yet). A judge's `consequence: exploratory|safety|gating` tag injects a default `min_alpha` of 0.67/0.70/0.80 at detection time (explicit values win; only 0.67 is literature-backed, 0.70/0.80 are author-proposed). The mapping key `simulator` is **reserved** (never a judge name): `thresholds.simulator` gates the run-level simulator block aggregated from the AskUserQuestion answer ledgers — `max_fallback_rate` (arbitrary-answer share), `min_gold_agreement` (held-out calibration-shadow agreement over human-provenance case overrides only), and `min_cross_simulator_agreement` (the all-agree rate between the primary hook answer and every `models.hook_shadow` shadow answer; configured without recorded shadow answers is a regression); stripped with a notice on the Harbor/EvalHub paths.

## Skills

### /eval-setup

Set up the evaluation environment: verify dependencies, configure MLflow tracking and tracing, check API keys, create directory structure.

### /eval-analyze

Analyze a target and generate `eval.yaml`. Two modes:

**Skill mode** (`--skill`): Examines the skill's SKILL.md, discovers test cases, and produces configuration with:
- `execution.mode: case` or `batch`
- Dataset schema, output descriptions
- Suggested judges (inline checks + LLM prompts)

**Prompt mode** (`--prompt`): Uses an analysis prompt to generate evaluation config. Domain-specific analysis prompts (see `examples/`) analyze repository documentation (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, ai-docs/) and produce:
- `execution.prompt: "{{ input.prompt }}"` (direct agent invocation)
- A `generation:` block with seeds (navigation, anti-pattern, authoring, component-usage, architecture)
- LLM rubric judges for semantic evaluation
- `generation.context` for test generation

```bash
/eval-analyze --skill my-skill                           # Skill mode: analyze skill implementation
/eval-analyze --skill my-skill --update                  # Update existing skill mode eval.yaml
/eval-analyze --prompt examples/openshift-agentic-docs.md # Prompt mode: analyze agentic documentation
/eval-analyze --prompt custom.md                         # Prompt mode: use custom analysis prompt
/eval-analyze --assess                                   # Batch: assess which skills would benefit from evals
```

Prompt mode is extensible. Create custom analysis prompts for other agent capability testing scenarios (code generation, API usage patterns, reasoning quality, etc.).

**Batch assessment** (`--assess`): profiles every skill in the project and classifies each as RECOMMENDED / OPTIONAL / SKIP / EXISTS, so you can decide where evals are worth building before analyzing any single skill. It ignores `--skill` and writes no config.

### /eval-dataset

Generate evaluation test cases. Case **provenance** is set in the config via `generation.strategy`:

- **`skill`** (default — no `generation` block needed): the agent authors realistic inputs from the skill analysis.
- **`synthetic`**: an LLM generates cases from `generation.seeds` + `generation.context` (from `/eval-analyze --prompt`).
- **`from-traces`**: cases are extracted from MLflow production traces.

Whether a run **creates a fresh set or augments an existing one** is derived from the current dataset (empty → fresh; populated → gap-fill) — there is no `--strategy` flag.

```bash
/eval-dataset                              # generate per the config's generation.strategy
/eval-dataset --count 20                   # target 20 cases (skill/from-traces; synthetic uses per-seed count)
/eval-dataset --run-id <id>                # augment, targeting failures from a prior eval run
```

**Synthetic generation** uses builtin generation prompts (`docs/navigation`, `docs/anti-pattern`, `docs/authoring`, `docs/component-usage`, `docs/architecture` — from `agent_eval/prompts/`) combined with repository-specific `generation.context` to create targeted test cases. Extensible with project-specific prompts via `prompt_file:` or inline `prompt:`.

### /eval-run

Execute the evaluation suite: prepare workspace, run the skill headlessly, collect artifacts, score with judges, detect regressions, and report results.

```
/eval-run --model opus                          # Run all cases
/eval-run --model opus --parallelism 3          # Run 3 cases concurrently
/eval-run --model opus --cases case-001         # Run specific case
/eval-run --model opus --baseline prev-run-id   # Compare against baseline
/eval-run --model opus --no-llm-judges          # Skip LLM judges
```

### /eval-compare

Compare evaluation results across multiple models or runs. Scans a directory of eval run artifacts (`summary.yaml`, `run_result.json`, `report.html`) and produces a self-contained tabbed HTML comparison report with model cards, quality/cost tables, per-case breakdowns, embedded per-run reports, and LLM-written analysis (Bottom Line, Where Each Model Shined, Shared Weaknesses, Recommendations).

```
/eval-compare <input-dir>                          # Discover runs and generate the report
/eval-compare <input-dir> --output <dir>           # Custom output directory
/eval-compare <input-dir> --title "Opus vs Sonnet" # Custom report title
/eval-compare <input-dir> --overview "<context>"   # Add a context paragraph
```

When an `/eval-anova` `anova.json` is present in the input directory, the report also gains an ANOVA/Pareto **Statistical Significance** section. eval-compare works standalone without it (it never imports the stats libraries).

### /eval-anova

Design-of-Experiments over a `matrix:` of agent configurations. eval-run runs one condition; `/eval-anova` reads the matrix and fans out `/eval-run` per cell (condition × replication) into standard runs, then computes repeated-measures / mixed-effects ANOVA + a cost/quality Pareto frontier over their `summary.yaml` files (`anova.json`) and renders the comparison via `/eval-compare`. Because the statistics read standard runs, it can also analyze runs produced by a CI fan-out. Requires the `anova` extra.

```
/eval-anova --config eval.yaml                # run every cell → analyze → report
/eval-anova --config eval.yaml --dry-run      # design + cost estimate, no execution
/eval-anova --config eval.yaml --analyze-only # re-analyze existing runs + re-render
```

See [`eval/anova-example/`](eval/anova-example/) for a self-contained worked example (committed sample runs let you reproduce the analysis + report offline).

### /eval-review

Interactive human review of eval results. Presents judge scores and outputs, collects qualitative feedback, analyzes patterns, and proposes SKILL.md changes.

```
/eval-review --run-id 2026-04-04-opus      # Review a completed run
/eval-review --run-id <id> --cases case-003 # Review specific cases
```

### /eval-mlflow

MLflow integration: sync datasets, log run results, attach judge feedback to traces. The agent reads the `schema` descriptions to understand case structure — no hardcoded field mappings.

```
/eval-mlflow --action sync-dataset              # Push cases to MLflow dataset
/eval-mlflow --run-id <id> --action log-results # Log scoring results
/eval-mlflow --run-id <id> --action push-feedback # Push judge+human feedback to traces
/eval-mlflow --run-id <id> --action pull-feedback # Pull MLflow UI annotations
/eval-mlflow --run-id <id>                      # Do everything
```

### /eval-optimize

Automated refinement loop: run eval, identify failures, read traces + judge rationale, edit the skill to fix issues, re-run to verify, check for regressions.

```
/eval-optimize --model opus --max-iterations 3
```

### /eval-check

Scan the full configuration (skills, commands, CLAUDE.md, hooks) as a system. Finds content overlap, trigger collisions, CLAUDE.md duplication, type misclassification, and broken cross-component references. Produces an informational report with restructuring suggestions.

```bash
/eval-check                        # Scan and report to harness-report.md
/eval-check --include-global       # Also scan ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
/eval-check --output my-report.md  # Custom output path
```

```

## Agent Support

The harness is agent-agnostic via the `EvalRunner` abstraction. Set `runner.type` in eval.yaml:

```yaml
runner:
  type: claude-code    # default — uses claude --print

runner:
  type: cli            # opaque CLI runner — delegates to an arbitrary command
  command: "my-runner run {agent} --model {model} --workspace {workspace}"
```

The `cli` runner executes a configurable command template with placeholder substitution. See **[docs/opaque-cli-runner-contract.md](docs/opaque-cli-runner-contract.md)** for the full contract (placeholders, metrics.json format, what the command MUST and SHOULD do).

A diagnostic `null` runner (do-nothing agent, for the `/eval-dataset` solvability probe) is CLI-only — invoke it with `--agent null` on execute.py; `runner.type: "null"` is rejected at config load.

Add new runners by subclassing `EvalRunner` in `agent_eval/agent/` and registering in `RUNNERS`.

## MLflow Tracing

The same tracing used by `/eval-mlflow` is available for standalone skill runs via `claude-trace` — a drop-in replacement for `claude --print` that captures stream-json output and builds hierarchical MLflow traces. See **[TRACING.md](TRACING.md)** for full documentation.

```bash
# Install with MLflow support
pip install -e "./agent-eval-harness[mlflow]"

# Run any skill with tracing
echo "/rfe.speedrun --input batch.yaml --headless" | claude-trace --model opus
```

## Dependencies

- `pyyaml >= 6.0`
- Optional: `mlflow[genai] >= 3.5` (for `/eval-mlflow` and `claude-trace`)
- Optional: `anthropic >= 0.40` (for LLM judges, pairwise comparison, synthetic dataset generation, and hook answering)
